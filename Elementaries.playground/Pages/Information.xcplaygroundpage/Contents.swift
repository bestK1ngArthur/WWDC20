 # Elementries:

 This playground helps pupils and younger students learn chemicals and memorize their formulas with a simple puzzle game. The gameplay of this game is based on an old paper game called the **Hungarian Crossword**.
 
 #### The Hungarian crossword is a field of cells in which the letters of answers are already inscribed. In the chain of cells that make up each response, neighboring cells must touch each other. Answer words do not overlap and do not have common cells with other words. This puzzle is much simpler than a classic crossword puzzle.

 ### Inspiration
  
 Science chemical notation, like the languages spoken by people, requires a certain amount of time to get used to it. Small puzzle games help solve this problem thanks to the gamification of the process. Hungarian crossword is a very suitable type of game, as its rules are quite simple and clear for all ages.
  
 ### Resources
  
 I tried to find examples of crossword puzzle filling algorithms on the Internet, but I really did not find any worthwhile ones. Therefore, I tried to write a complex algorithm myself and it turned out quite well. The program also allows you to install any custom algorithm. I will tell you more about this later.
  
 In the program, I did not use any third-party libraries. All UI elements are drawn using only the SpriteKit framework.
